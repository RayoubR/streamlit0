As the name suggests, the lessee is merely hiring the car for a contracted length of time.

"12","11","False","36:44.0","If a deal is advertising as ‘in stock’ this means that the vehicle in question doesn’t have to be built to order and is ready to go, so delivery should be faster. They’re a great option if you don’t want to wait for a car to be built, although you may have to be flexible when it comes to specification and colour options. Please note, some stock vehicles may also be pre-registered, which is a new car that has already been registered with the DVLA by a dealership, leasing company, or broker, but hasn't been used by anyone else.","","11"
"13","12","True","36:44.0","Is insurance included in a car lease deal?","14",""
"14","13","False","36:44.0","No. Because the cost of insurance can vary wildly between drivers, it is impossible to accurately factor in insurance costs with our monthly lease rates.

"18","17","False","36:44.0","Yes you can lease multiple vehicles, providing you pass the relevant credit and affordability checks.

"20","19","False","36:44.0","Road tax, or Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) to give it its proper name, will normally be included within the price. All lease agreements should include road tax either for the duration of the contract or for the first 12 months.","","19"

"24","44","False","36:44.0","You can choose deals with servicing included, although not all lease companies will offer this. If the deal does come with maintenance, the lease company will pay for all servicing and scheduled maintenance, but some consumables such as tyres and windscreen wipers may not be included.
If the deal does not have maintenance included you will have to pay for servicing. The terms and conditions of the lease may stipulate that this is done at a franchised dealer or manufacturer-approved service centre. As the car is likely to be under warranty for the duration of the lease, any faults will be repaired under warranty and you may be able to purchase a servicing package.","","23"

"26","1213","False","36:44.0","This means how many months upfront you can pay as you initial rental on your choice of car lease. So if you were looking at leasing a car for £199.99 per month and the deal states that the initial rental is six months you would pay £1,199.94 in the first month, outside of any additional fees.
Your initial rental will usually be taken between 1 and 3 weeks AFTER your vehicle has been delivered - you can class this as your first month’s payment.","","25"

Choosing wisely will save irritating and potentially expensive surcharges.","","27"

"40","1010","False","36:44.0","If the windscreen of your leased car develops a crack or chip, the options open to you depend on your leasing agreement.

From there it is up to you which one you use.","","39"

"42","1010","False","36:44.0","The vehicle is your responsibility. Please take care of it. During your time with the vehicle, it must be used, maintained and looked after according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. At the end of the contract minor damage such as small stone chips and bumper scuffs are unlikely to be an issue under the ‘fair wear and tear’ clause found in lease contracts. But more severe damage will need to be fixed by an approved repair centre","","41"

"44","1010","False","36:44.0","If a leased car is stolen or written off the insurance company will negotiate directly with the leasing company. Different companies have varying policies.
